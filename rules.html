                                        Rule 10 - Calling a Penalty

                                    </b>

                                    Should an infraction of the rules that would result in a minor, major, misconduct,
                                    game misconduct or match penalty be committed by a player or goalkeeper of the side
                                    in possession of the ball, the Referee shall immediately blow the play dead and
                                    penalize the offending player of goalkeeper.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Should an infraction be committed while the other team is in possession of the ball,
                                    the Referee shall raise his arm to signal a penalty and blow the play dead once the
                                    offending team has gained possession of the ball. The offending player will then be
                                    penalized.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    If a goal is scored when a team without possession of the ball is to be called for a
                                    penalty, the Referee will use his discretion to decide whether the penalty will
                                    still be assessed after the goal. Generally, flagrant penalties (i.e., butt-ending,
                                    high-sticking majors, spearing) will be assessed.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Possession of ball is defined for the purposes of this rule as 'control of the ball'
                                    not simply 'touching the ball' (i.e., if the ball deflects off of a player on the
                                    infraction team or if he deflects it with his stick, it does not constitute
                                    possession and no stoppage in play would occur).

                                    will be selected by the Captain of the offending team to serve the penalty.

                                    The team assessed a minor penalty will be considered 'short-handed.' The team is
                                    short-handed (i.e. at a numerical disadvantage) until the penalty expires and the
                                    player is allowed to return, or until the opposing team scores while at a numerical
                                    advantage (power play).
                                    <br> <br>
                                    If both teams are assessed minor penalties, neither team will be short-handed. The
                                    penalties will be coincidental, and the teams will play five-on-five. If a team
                                    scores while the teams are playing five-on-five, neither penalty will expire early.
                                    If the penalties are not coincidental (i.e., one team has a tripping call and other
                                    team has a roughing call), play will resume at four-on-four until the penalties have
                                    expired. If a team scores while the teams are playing four-on-four, neither penalty
                                    will expire early.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    In the case of two players from the same team being penalized at the same time, the
                                    player whose penalty is to expire first will return first. This will occur either
                                    when (a) the penalty time is expired or when (b) the team on the power-play scores.
                                    If both players were assessed penalties at the same time, the captain will decide
                                    who returns first in the case of a power play goal.

                                    A bench minor penalty involves the removal from the floor of one player of the team
                                    against which the penalty is assessed for a period of three (3) minutes. Any player

                                    Captain and such player shall take his place on the penalty bench promptly and serve
                                    the penalty as if it was a minor penalty imposed upon him.

                                    captain.

                                    17.1 Penalty Shot
                                    <br> <br>
                                    A penalty shot is designed to restore a scoring opportunity that was lost as a
                                    result of a foul being committed by the offending team.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Refer to Table 5 - Summary of Penalties that may result in Penalty Shots for a list
                                    of infractions that can result in a penalty shot.

                                    17.2 Procedure
                                    <br> <br>
                                    A penalty shot is to be called by the Referee in the same fashion as a minor
                                    penalty. When play is stopped, he will point to center ice to signify the penalty
                                    shot. The ball will be placed at center ice and all players but the two participants
                                    must clear the playing area. One Referee will stand at center to blow his whistle
                                    when both players are ready, allowing the shooter to play the ball. The other
                                    Referee will stand at the goal line to call goal or no goal. The shooter must
                                    maintain forward momentum and the ball must continue to have forward momentum, or
                                    the play is dead. No goal can be scored on a rebound of any kind (an exception being
                                    the ball off the goal post or crossbar, then the goalkeeper and then directly into
                                    the goal), and any time the ball crosses the goal line or comes to a complete stop,
                                    the shot shall be considered complete.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    The lacrosse-like move whereby the ball is picked up on the blade of the stick and
                                    'whipped' into the net shall be permitted provided the ball is not raised above the
                                    height of the shoulders at any time and when released, is not carried higher than
                                    the crossbar. Please note that if the player makes contact with the ball above the
                                    height of the shoulders, it will not result in a minor penalty for high-sticking.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    The spin-o-rama type move where the player completes a 360Â° turn as he approaches
                                    the goal, shall be permitted as this involves continuous motion.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    The goalkeeper must remain in his crease until the player taking the penalty shot
                                    has touched the ball.
                                    <br> <br>

                                    <br> <br>
                                    If the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded was such as to normally incur
                                    a minor penalty, then regardless of whether the penalty shot results in a goal or
                                    not, no further minor penalty shall be served.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    If the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded was such as to incur a
                                    double-minor penalty, or where the offending team is assessed an additional minor
                                    penalty on the same play in which a penalty shot was awarded, the first minor
                                    penalty is not assessed since the penalty shot was awarded to restore the lost
                                    scoring opportunity. The second minor penalty would be assessed and served
                                    regardless of whether the penalty shot results in a goal.

                                    In cases where a penalty shot has been awarded to a player specifically fouled, that
                                    player shall be designated by the Referee to take the penalty shot. In all other
                                    cases where a penalty shot has been awarded, the penalty shot shall be taken by a
                                    player selected by the Captain from the players on the floor at the time when the
                                    foul was committed. Such selection shall be reported to the Referee.

                                    committed in the neutral zone by a player of either side, the ensuing face-off shall

                                    If an attacking player is to be penalized, and the play is stopped due to the
                                    actions of a defending player (i.e. ball frozen by the goalkeeper) the ensuing
                                    face-off will remain in the defending zone of the non-offending team. This is also
                                    true for situations whereby the attacking team is penalized after the play has been
                                    stopped in the attacking zone by an act by the defending team. The face-off would
                                    remain in the non-offending team's end zone.

                                    face-off spot in that zone.

                                    Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the point
                                    players or any player coming from the bench of the attacking team, enter into the
                                    attacking zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone face-off circle during an
                                    altercation, gathering or 'scrum,' the ensuing face-off shall take place in the
                                    neutral zone near the blue line of the defending team. This rule also applies when
                                    an icing or an intentional off-side has occurred, and the ensuing face-off is to be
                                    in the offending team's defending zone.

                                    When play is stopped for an injured player, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted
                                    at the face-off spot in the zone nearest the location of the ball when the play was
                                    stopped. When the injured player's team has possession of the ball in the attacking
                                    zone, the face-off shall be conducted at one of the face-off spots outside the blue
                                    line in the neutral zone. When the injured player is in his defending zone and the
                                    attacking team is in possession of the ball in the attacking zone, the face-off
                                    shall be conducted at one of the defending team's end-zone face-off spots.

                                    must squarely face each other with stick blades flat on floor outside the face-off

                                    Players cannot raise their stick or make contact with the ball until it has made
                                    contact with floor. If the ball is dropped unfairly by the Referee, the face-off
                                    will immediately be repeated. If a player gains an unfair advantage (as deemed by
                                    the Referee) by raising or moving his stick early and making contact with the ball
                                    before it touches the floor, the he will be waived out of the face-off and is to be
                                    replaced by another player on his team. The face-off will be done again at the same
                                    spot. If the substitute player is also called for gaining an unfair advantage, the
                                    team will be assessed a bench minor penalty for Delay of Game. The penalty must be
                                    served by a player on the floor.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The same rule applies for other players (wingers and defenders) who step inside the
                                    face-off circle before the ball is dropped. After the first offence, the offending
                                    team's center will have to be replaced by another player.
                                    <br><br>
                                    If a team is, in the opinion of the Referee, taking too long to line-up for
                                    face-offs, they will be given one warning and then assessed a bench minor penalty
                                    for Delay of Game to be served by any player on the floor designated by the Captain.

                                    Play will not be stopped for any hand pass by players in their own defending zone
                                    (within the blue line). A hand pass in the defending zone is considered to have
                                    occurred when both the player making the pass and the player receiving the pass have
                                    both of their feet inside their defending zone (within the blue line). If the

                                    offensive team having the zone, the play is stopped.

                                    2. Referees need time to discuss calls such as penalties or allowing goals.

                                    Icing is only in effect when there is stop time (less than three minutes left in the
                                    game and a goal differential of three or less). For the purpose of this rule, the

                                    For the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the ball by the team in

                                    the team in possession must 'gain the line' in order for the icing to be nullified.
                                    'Gaining the line' shall mean that the ball (not the player's foot) must make
                                    contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing. For the
                                    purpose of interpretation of the rule, 'icing the ball' is completed the instant the
                                    ball passes the goal line (no touch icing).

                                    to play the ball, or heads in the direction of the ball on an icing at any time, the

                                    If, in the Referee's opinion, a defending player is able to touch the ball before

                                    The position of the player's feet and not that of his stick shall be the determining
                                    factor in all instances in deciding an off-side. A player is off-side when both feet
                                    are completely over the leading edge of the blue line involved in the play.
                                    <br><br>
                                    A player is on-side when either of his feet are in contact with, or on his own side
                                    of the line, at the instant the ball completely crosses the leading edge of the blue
                                    line regardless of the position of his stick.

                                    However, a player actually controlling the ball who shall cross the line ahead of
                                    the ball shall not be considered 'off-side,' provided he had possession and control

                                    <br><br>
                                    It should be noted that while the position of the player's ball is what determines
                                    whether a player is 'off-side,' nevertheless the question of an 'off-side' never
                                    arises until the ball has completely crossed the leading edge of the blue line at
                                    which time the decision is to be made.

                                    Once the attacking team has gained legal entry into the offensive zone, the center
                                    red line will serve as the blue line for the purpose of this rule. As a result,
                                    attacking players are free to play the ball outside the blue line until it is played
                                    outside the red line.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Once the ball is played outside the red line, the attacking team will only have to
                                    clear the blue line in order to gain entry into the zone once again.
